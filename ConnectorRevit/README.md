## Introduction

This repo holds the Speckle Revit Connector. We'd really appreciate any feedback, comments, suggestions, etc âœ¨

## Documentation

Comprehensive developer and user documentation can be found in our:

#### ðŸ“š [Speckle Docs website](https://speckle.guide/dev/)

## Developing & Debugging

### Requirements

- Revit 2019 or above
- Visual Studio 2019 or above (or similar IDE)
- A Speckle account (you can make one at https://speckle.xyz/)

### Getting Started

#### Accounts

To use Speckle, you'll need a Speckle account. This can be in our XYZ server, in a local server or anywhere else.
You can log in to your account:
- from Manager, available at https://speckle-releases.netlify.app/
- or, if using our latest release, you can also log in directly from the Revit connector

### Debugging

In your IDE, select the version of the Revit project you want to debug:

Ensure the right Start action is set:

And then you can click debug. The post build actions will copy all necessary files, so next you just need to launch the connector:

If you're having SQLite issues when building, make doubly sure that you're on x64.

#### Conversions

All the conversion routines are in the converter project:

You might need to debug the Converter project instead of the Connector one if your IDE doesn't reach the breakpoints correctly.
