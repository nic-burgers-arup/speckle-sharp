## Usage

Once SpeckleGSA is installed, run the program directly. It will take care of opening GSA - you cannot access SpeckleGSA if you run GSA directly.

SpeckleGSA implements key components of a Speckle client in it's tab interface:
- Server:
    - Allows users to login to a SpeckleServer
- GSA:
    - Create or open a GSA file
- Sender:
    - Sends model to a SpeckleServer
- Receiver:
    - Receive stream(s) from a SpeckleServer
- Settings
